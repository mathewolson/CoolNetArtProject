## Week 1 - Dynamic Web Development

 -----

 This was a pretty quick and dirty exercise in trying to shake off the cobwebs on what little HTML and CSS experience I have. I decided to make a very early '90s webpage (well, with better images) dedicated to my partner's pet rabbit Pablo.

 To create this site I followed the [your first website](https://github.com/muji786/spring2023-dynamic-web-development/blob/main/guides/your-first-website-guide.md) guide and reacquainted myself with the wonders of w3schools, mostly looking at these reference pages:

 [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)
 [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp)
 [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.php](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.php)

 Remembering that CSS stands for "_cascading_ style sheets," I tried to get a bit fancy and thought I might make one "center" style that could handle the text, image sizing, and the second set of images that I wanted to keep in a row. But I couldn't immediately wrap my head around how I'd do that. Clearly need to spend more quality time with w3.
